                     practice analogous to Western mission hospitals. He sat on a raised pedestal
                     with his patients seated before him. Each, in turn, would come to the front and
                     state his troubles. Kutupu would ask for a sum of money (which varied with the
                     distance traveled by the seeker) and place it under the cover of the Koran. He
                     then placed a medicine horn, ormina,on top of the book and discussed the patient's troubles with him
                     or her. After a while, he picked up the book and used it as an oracle. He would
                     say, â€œIf the person's troubles are the result of his/her having broken a food
                     taboo, then the money should disappear.â€ He then passed the book three times
                     around his back for a woman and four for a man. If the money was still there,
                     he would choose another cause: â€œIf the troubles are the result of someone
                     making bad medicineâ€ or â€œthat an eviljina(malefic spirit) is the problem.â€
                     Kutupu then turned the book behind his back so that the other side was face up.
                     When he opened the book the money seemed to have disappeared. Then he would
                     discuss how to cure the patient; to show the effectiveness of the diagnosis, he
                     made the money reappear by again turning the book behind his back. Because I

                           the restoring, repairing or beautifying of the person. Extending its
                           meaning, the Karanga include the ritual home-bringing of the person
                           because this corresponds to a restoration of the original order.But the idea of restoring or repairing is much
                           more comprehensive to the Karanga because much more than the bringing
                           home of the deceased is meant. To them the process ofkugadzira,of the
                           restoring, starts already at death. To the Karanga,kugadzirameans
                           closing the dead man's eyes, washing his body and doing all that is
                           necessary in preparing it for burial (cf p. 228 seq). If these duties
                           towards the deceased are not carried out, he could say to whoever is
                           responsible: â€œHamuna
                              kundigadzira:you did not restore meâ€. One prerequisite
                           for the actual home-bringing of the deceased is â€œfinishing the maize
                           porridgeâ€, which is also regarded as a form ofkugadzira(cf p. 265). This is
                           because if an angry ancestral spirit were partly responsible for the
                           death, the deceased could be introduced to his own ancestors only after
                           an act of reconciliation.The two ceremonies (of the â€œbeer of the waterâ€
                           and of the â€œgoat of angerâ€) also are seen as the actual start of the
                           restoration of normal conditions. The process of re-integration is
                           started in fact by the renewal of the identity with the â€œembryoâ€ in the
                           â€œuterusâ€ of the earth. The climax of the restoration is the appropriately
                           namedkugadzira-ceremony (when the deceased is accepted by the
                           ancestors) which contains the most essential aspect of the ritual.This ceremony is of decisive significance for
                           every dead man because it determines how he will exist as a spirit.
                           Various aspects must be taken into account though.First, the â€œembryonic stateâ€ of the deceased â€”
                           a special form of existence â€” must be stressed. The Karanga referred to
                           the granary in which the personal belongings of the deceased are stored
                           (cf p. 238 seq). As thekugadzira-ceremony corresponds to a symbolical birth,
                           the time previous to it is to be seen as a kind of pregnancy, they say.
                              Parentsinsert_drive_file289cannot â€œuseâ€ a child
                           before it is born. Thus, the dead man's things which symbolize him may
                           not be used. Also, they say, whatever belongs to the unborn must not be
                           seen, not even by relatives. This refers to the special position and
                           isolation of the embryo (cf pp 242, 245).It will be recalled that the â€œbeer of the
                           waterâ€ too is regarded by many (not all) Karanga as a birth. Some aspects
                           connected with this were unfortunately investigated insufficiently by me,
                           and so they remain somewhat uncertain. A few considerations may, however,
                           help to solve the contradiction. To the Karanga, birth often has a
                           figurative meaning. One simply wants to pinpoint a new beginning, or an
                           important state in a process. However, it may be that the â€œamniotic
                           fluidâ€ of the ceremony does not refer to birth but only to pregnancy.
                           This, I think would be confirmed by many Karanga.The special position and
                           initial isolation of the deceased is, however, stressed particularly by
                           his journey in the â€œland where there is no waterâ€ (cf p. 272). He cannot
                           even go to his own ancestors (for the symbolical significance of this
                           condition, cf p. 245). Let me add here a few complementary remarks with
                           regard to previous ones (cf p. 244 seq). This journey is explained in
                           various ways. Some say that the deceased has to undergo a process of
                           purification and so must wander about until the ceremony. (Could
                           Christian ideology have perhaps influenced traditional belief here?)
                           Others (but only a few) maintain that the dead go to the great ancestors
                           â€œas shadowsâ€ and are judged there. Only very good men can remain with the
                           ancestors, most are sent on a journey with the words: â€œReturn and bury
                           yourshunguâ€.Others again give details about the place where
                           the spirits can stay before thekugadzira-ceremony. Generally it
                           is assumed that the deceased wanders about in the â€œland without waterâ€.
                           There are some (but they are exceptions) who search for an animal, a big
                           tree or a pond (a river creek) in order to remain with them until the
                           ceremony. Where the spirit stays can possibly be decisive, they say, with
                           regard to his future existence, i.e. whether the deceased becomes an
                           ancestral or an alien spirit.For example: an old Karanga told us that there
                           was a tree near his village. One day it was noted that beer had lately
                           begun to go sour sooner than usual. A traditional doctor was consulted,
                           and he pronounced asinsert_drive_file290follows: â€œThe big tree near
                           your village wants sweet beer for there is a shadow in it.â€As a rule this is an alien spirit(shave)looking
                           for a medium. But it could also be a dead consanguine, although this is
                           rare. In this way, a dead man can become an alien as well as an ancestral
                           spirit: with strangers he obtainsshave-status; with his own
                           people, through thekugadzira-ceremony, he becomes an ancestor.Therefore, the
                           ceremony of the home-bringing is described by the Karanga as the most
                           crucial in the â€œlifeâ€ of a spirit because it decides finally on his
                           status and on where he belongs. Thekugadzira-ceremony not only
                           brings back the deceased to a certain clan and family (so that he need
                           not search in strange places), it also gives him a permanent â€œresidenceâ€
                           where he receives agono(cf pp. 167*, 335 seq) and can even choose a medium.

                           phase of thekugadzira-ceremony is aptly portrayed in a song. These
                           songs also reflect general thoughts on death, for instance:â€œBwirira chishanga kwawakabva

                           the deceased to first return to where his journey began, for it was there
                           (or since he was there) that he was attracted and fascinated by the
                           pleasure and beauty life offered him. Therefore, he began his first
                           journey without being prepared properly. However, it is said to be always
                           hard to prepare for such a journey because of the beauty and pleasure of
                           this world â€” hence one reason of hisshungu.One wants the deceased

                           the restoring, repairing or beautifying of the person. Extending its
                           meaning, the Karanga include the ritual home-bringing of the person
                           because this corresponds to a restoration of the original order.But the idea of restoring or repairing is much
                           more comprehensive to the Karanga because much more than the bringing
                           home of the deceased is meant. To them the process ofkugadzira,of the
                           restoring, starts already at death. To the Karanga,kugadzirameans
                           closing the dead man's eyes, washing his body and doing all that is
                           necessary in preparing it for burial (cf p. 228 seq). If these duties
                           towards the deceased are not carried out, he could say to whoever is
                           responsible: ?œHamuna
                              kundigadzira:you did not restore me?. One prerequisite
                           for the actual home-bringing of the deceased is ?œfinishing the maize
                           porridge?, which is also regarded as a form ofkugadzira(cf p. 265). This is
                           because if an angry ancestral spirit were partly responsible for the
                           death, the deceased could be introduced to his own ancestors only after
                           an act of reconciliation.The two ceremonies (of the ?œbeer of the water?
                           and of the ?œgoat of anger?) also are seen as the actual start of the
                           restoration of normal conditions. The process of re-integration is
                           started in fact by the renewal of the identity with the ?œembryo? in the
                           ?œuterus? of the earth. The climax of the restoration is the appropriately
                           namedkugadzira-ceremony (when the deceased is accepted by the
                           ancestors) which contains the most essential aspect of the ritual.This ceremony is of decisive significance for
                           every dead man because it determines how he will exist as a spirit.
                           Various aspects must be taken into account though.First, the ?œembryonic state? of the deceased ?”
                           a special form of existence ?” must be stressed. The Karanga referred to
                           the granary in which the personal belongings of the deceased are stored
                           (cf p. 238 seq). As thekugadzira-ceremony corresponds to a symbolical birth,
                           the time previous to it is to be seen as a kind of pregnancy, they say.
                              Parentsinsert_drive_file289cannot ?œuse? a child
                           before it is born. Thus, the dead man's things which symbolize him may
                           not be used. Also, they say, whatever belongs to the unborn must not be
                           seen, not even by relatives. This refers to the special position and
                           isolation of the embryo (cf pp 242, 245).It will be recalled that the ?œbeer of the
                           water? too is regarded by many (not all) Karanga as a birth. Some aspects
                           connected with this were unfortunately investigated insufficiently by me,
                           and so they remain somewhat uncertain. A few considerations may, however,
                           help to solve the contradiction. To the Karanga, birth often has a
                           figurative meaning. One simply wants to pinpoint a new beginning, or an
                           important state in a process. However, it may be that the ?œamniotic
                           fluid? of the ceremony does not refer to birth but only to pregnancy.
                           This, I think would be confirmed by many Karanga.The special position and
                           initial isolation of the deceased is, however, stressed particularly by
                           his journey in the ?œland where there is no water? (cf p. 272). He cannot
                           even go to his own ancestors (for the symbolical significance of this
                           condition, cf p. 245). Let me add here a few complementary remarks with
                           regard to previous ones (cf p. 244 seq). This journey is explained in
                           various ways. Some say that the deceased has to undergo a process of
                           purification and so must wander about until the ceremony. (Could
                           Christian ideology have perhaps influenced traditional belief here?)
                           Others (but only a few) maintain that the dead go to the great ancestors
                           ?œas shadows? and are judged there. Only very good men can remain with the
                           ancestors, most are sent on a journey with the words: ?œReturn and bury
                           yourshungu?.Others again give details about the place where
                           the spirits can stay before thekugadzira-ceremony. Generally it
                           is assumed that the deceased wanders about in the ?œland without water?.
                           There are some (but they are exceptions) who search for an animal, a big
                           tree or a pond (a river creek) in order to remain with them until the
                           ceremony. Where the spirit stays can possibly be decisive, they say, with
                           regard to his future existence, i.e. whether the deceased becomes an
                           ancestral or an alien spirit.For example: an old Karanga told us that there
                           was a tree near his village. One day it was noted that beer had lately
                           begun to go sour sooner than usual. A traditional doctor was consulted,
                           and he pronounced asinsert_drive_file290follows: ?œThe big tree near
                           your village wants sweet beer for there is a shadow in it.?As a rule this is an alien spirit(shave)looking
                           for a medium. But it could also be a dead consanguine, although this is
                           rare. In this way, a dead man can become an alien as well as an ancestral
                           spirit: with strangers he obtainsshave-status; with his own
                           people, through thekugadzira-ceremony, he becomes an ancestor.Therefore, the
                           ceremony of the home-bringing is described by the Karanga as the most
                           crucial in the ?œlife? of a spirit because it decides finally on his
                           status and on where he belongs. Thekugadzira-ceremony not only
                           brings back the deceased to a certain clan and family (so that he need
                           not search in strange places), it also gives him a permanent ?œresidence?
                           where he receives agono(cf pp. 167*, 335 seq) and can even choose a medium.
                           More of that later (cf p. 351 seq).The condition of the deceased as he enters the
                           phase of thekugadzira-ceremony is aptly portrayed in a song. These

                        wood. Similar tales are told of all the forests. Mboza says:A woman was imprudent enough to cut some dry
                              branches in the sacred wood of Masinge, near Morakwen. She at once
                              heard an unusual voice: biâ€¦ biâ€¦ and received blows. She ran away home
                              leaving her garment in the bush. Having arrived home, she asked her
                              husband to go and fetch it, but he refused, from fear. Nkomuza, the
                              guardian of the forest, went to fetch it, but they had to reward him
                              with a bottle of wine.An older story about the same forest runs as
                              follows: â€” In olden times the gods were frequently seen marching in
                              file, going to draw water from the well. They had their own road. They
                              were of short stature, the women carrying babies in thentehe,but,
                              strange to say, with the feet up and the head downwards! A man, called
                              Mishimhongo, built his village near to the forest. The gods, angry
                              with him, entered his huts while he was busy with all his people
                              working in the fields. Only a little child remained in the village,
                              and the gods wrapped him up in a mat, and hid him somewhere behind the
                              huts. Then they went to the garden and shouted: â€œMishimhongo! There
                              are visitors in your village.â€ The man looked to see who was calling
                              him, but saw no one. He went home, and found that the child had
                              disappeared. In the evening the gods came and said to him: â€œLook
                              behind the huts. But move at once; do not remain near our road! If you
                              do so, we shall kill you and your child.â€ The poor man needed no
                              second warning!Not far from this place, in the Nkanyen
                              district, is the sacred wood of Tlhatlha. An enormous pot is said to
                              have been placed there long ago, a marvellous pot which possesses the
                              faculty of locomotion. It can move as far as that village yonder (half
                              a mile). But though it may have arrived only yesterday at the spot
                              where you see it, it is quite hidden in the grass and shrubs, as if it
                              had been there for years! It takes its walk from one end of the graves
                              to the other. It is taboo to touch it! When the Portuguese tried to
                              establish a camp there, they heard strange noises during the night,
                              drums, trumpets, etc. The Landis (Natives) said to them: â€œTake care!
                              There are gods here.â€ So they removed their camp to Morakwen. (Mboza.)The wood of Tembe, called Mudlomadlomana, is
                              very celebrated.insert_drive_file383It is said that, in
                              olden days, there was an anchor there, and before sacrificing, the
                              priest always used to lift it up, and let it fall to the ground,
                              saying: â€œShawan! (I salute thee) Tembe!â€ If the sacrifice was
                              acceptable the sound of a trumpet: â€œbvÃ©â€¦ bvÃ©â€¦,â€ was heard, far away in
                              the depths of the woods, but no form was ever seen. This anchor also
                              possessed extraordinary powers. When the country was at war with its

                              some terrible catastrophe!Load in context776Spirits and Gods778Sacred Objects and Places","These stories are by no means restricted to the Libombo sacred
                        wood. Similar tales are told of all the forests. Mboza says:A woman was imprudent enough to cut some dry
                              branches in the sacred wood of Masinge, near Morakwen. She at once
                              heard an unusual voice: bi... bi... and received blows. She ran away home
                              leaving her garment in the bush. Having arrived home, she asked her
                              husband to go and fetch it, but he refused, from fear. Nkomuza, the
                              guardian of the forest, went to fetch it, but they had to reward him
                              with a bottle of wine.An older story about the same forest runs as
                              follows: ?” In olden times the gods were frequently seen marching in
                              file, going to draw water from the well. They had their own road. They
                              were of short stature, the women carrying babies in thentehe,but,
                              strange to say, with the feet up and the head downwards! A man, called
                              Mishimhongo, built his village near to the forest. The gods, angry
                              with him, entered his huts while he was busy with all his people
                              working in the fields. Only a little child remained in the village,
                              and the gods wrapped him up in a mat, and hid him somewhere behind the
                              huts. Then they went to the garden and shouted: ?œMishimhongo! There
                              are visitors in your village.? The man looked to see who was calling
                              him, but saw no one. He went home, and found that the child had
                              disappeared. In the evening the gods came and said to him: ?œLook
                              behind the huts. But move at once; do not remain near our road! If you
                              do so, we shall kill you and your child.? The poor man needed no
                              second warning!Not far from this place, in the Nkanyen
                              district, is the sacred wood of Tlhatlha. An enormous pot is said to
                              have been placed there long ago, a marvellous pot which possesses the
                              faculty of locomotion. It can move as far as that village yonder (half
                              a mile). But though it may have arrived only yesterday at the spot
                              where you see it, it is quite hidden in the grass and shrubs, as if it
                              had been there for years! It takes its walk from one end of the graves
                              to the other. It is taboo to touch it! When the Portuguese tried to
                              establish a camp there, they heard strange noises during the night,
                              drums, trumpets, etc. The Landis (Natives) said to them: ?œTake care!
                              There are gods here.? So they removed their camp to Morakwen. (Mboza.)The wood of Tembe, called Mudlomadlomana, is
                              very celebrated.insert_drive_file383It is said that, in
                              olden days, there was an anchor there, and before sacrificing, the
                              priest always used to lift it up, and let it fall to the ground,
                              saying: ?œShawan! (I salute thee) Tembe!? If the sacrifice was
                              acceptable the sound of a trumpet: ?œbvé... bvé...,? was heard, far away in
                              the depths of the woods, but no form was ever seen. This anchor also
                              possessed extraordinary powers. When the country was at war with its
                              neighbours, and matters did not go well with Tembe, the anchor would
                              move off by itself into the Matjolo district. This was the portent of

               all public occasions; there is hardly an event of any size that is not, in one way or
               another, connected with a political party or political interests. In this instance,
               however, the spirit of thehillulaseems to have inhibited any attempt to transform it into a
               political gathering. This mystical occasion celebrating thezaddik,set within the awesome confines of a
               cemetery, is perceived as an inappropriate time and place for such mundane behavior
               as distributing political party propaganda or attempting to generate support for a
               particular party or candidate. It would simply not be fitting or proper conduct, too
